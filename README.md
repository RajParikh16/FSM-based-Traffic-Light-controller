# FSM-based-Traffic-Light-controller
Project Description: Includes design module with four state FSM that runs on three different time delays to control the flow of traffic. The design is implemented on Basys 2 development board.                        Technologies: Verilog(Design module), Xilinx ISE (for Structural modelling, Place &amp; Route), EDA wave(Simulation)
